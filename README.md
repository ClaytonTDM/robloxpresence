# roblox presence

sends roblox activity (joins, leaves) to a discord webhook (and logs chat if you want)

## how to use webhook

pick the exe you prefer in the [releases tab](https://github.com/ClaytonTDM/robloxpresence/releases)

the webhook is in [this discord server](https://discord.gg/nyJc5SSCgg)

when you join/leave a game, it gets logged there along with some info abt the game

you could technically call this an "infinite friends glitch" cause now you dont need to friend someone to join their game

## how to use chat logger

chat logger is only supported in games that choose to support it. if you want to add it to your game, put [this model](https://roblox.com/library/15100533347) in workspace

## credits and other stuff

tanks pizzaboxer for making bloxstrap open source 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊

the cache stuff is for later, i might make an (opt in) option that dumps your asset cache to the server when you leave
